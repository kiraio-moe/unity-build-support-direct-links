# Unity Build Support Direct Download Links

Taking too long to download Build Support/Playback Engine using Unity Download Assistant?  
No worry... You can use the direct download link below and download it using your favorite Download Manager!

All links are obtained from the official Unity server, so it's safe.  
I limit the version of Unity that I think is still often used.

Because of Markdown limitation, I separate each major version.

- [Unity 2022](./unity_2022/README.md "Unity 2022")
- [Unity 2021](./unity_2021/README.md "Unity 2021")
- [Unity 2020](./unity_2020/README.md "Unity 2020")
